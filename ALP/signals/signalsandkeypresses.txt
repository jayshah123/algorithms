Ctrl-C
	Pressing this key causes the system to send an SIGINT to the running process , u can do the same by running the process in background and sending 
a kill -2 [pid] via cmd.

Ctrl-Z
	Pressing this key causes the system to send a SIGSTP to the running process.

pause() is a system call that waits for a signal

i recommend run the process in background and use kill command from the console to send signals to the process,
use man kill if required.
